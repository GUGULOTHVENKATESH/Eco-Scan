# 🌍 EcoScan - Clothing Carbon Footprint Scanner

## 📜 Overview

EcoScan is a full-stack web application designed to help users understand the environmental impact of their clothing choices. By uploading images of clothing items, users can see estimated carbon scores, earn eco-reward points, and redeem sustainability-focused offers. This project demonstrates a complete MERN stack solution for a green initiative product, built as part of the **Reewild Full Stack Engineer Take Home Challenge**.

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18 with JavaScript (no TypeScript)
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom gradients and animations
- **Image Recognition**: OpenAI GPT-4 Vision API (with mock fallback)
- **File Upload**: Multer with image validation
- **HTTP Client**: Axios for API communication
- **Icons**: Lucide React for beautiful, consistent icons

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- OpenAI API key (optional, for real AI analysis)

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ecoscan-reewild-challenge.git
cd ecoscan-reewild-challenge
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
Install dependencies for both frontend and backend:
```bash
npm run install:all
```

Or install manually:
```bash
# Install root dependencies
npm install

# Install backend dependencies
cd server && npm install

# Install frontend dependencies
cd ../client && npm install
```

### 3. Environment Configuration
Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory:
```bash
cd server
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit the `.env` file:
```env
PORT=5000
NODE_ENV=development
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

**Note**: If you don't have an OpenAI API key, the app will use mock image recognition.

### 4. Run the Application
Start both frontend and backend servers:
```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start:
- **Backend**: http://localhost:5000
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:5173

### 5. Alternative: Manual Start
Start servers separately:

**Backend** (Terminal 1):
```bash
cd server
npm run dev
```

**Frontend** (Terminal 2):
```bash
cd client
npm run dev
```

---

## 🧪 Testing

Run the backend test suite:
```bash
npm test
```

Or run tests directly:
```bash
cd server
npm test
```

The test suite covers:
- Carbon footprint calculations
- Offers filtering logic
- Mock image recognition
- Edge cases and error handling
- Impact level classifications

## 🌱 Carbon Score Assumptions

EcoScan uses research-based estimates for clothing carbon footprints. These values represent the approximate CO₂ emissions from production, transportation, and processing:

| 👕 Item | 🌍 Estimated Carbon Score (kg CO₂) | 📊 Impact Level |
|----------|-----------------------------------|-----------------|
| T-shirt | 5 | Low-Medium |
| Jeans | 10 | Medium-High |
| Sweater | 7 | Medium |
| Jacket | 12 | High |
| Dress | 8 | Medium |
| Shirt | 4 | Low |
| Pants | 9 | Medium |
| Skirt | 6 | Medium |
| Hoodie | 8 | Medium |
| Shorts | 3 | Low |
| Shoes | 8 | Medium |
| Socks | 2 | Low |
| Coat | 15 | Very High |
| Blazer | 10 | Medium-High |

### Eco-Points Calculation
```javascript
ecoPoints = Math.max(0, 50 - totalCarbon)
```
- **Base Points**: 50 points
- **Deduction**: 1 point per kg CO₂
- **Incentive**: Lower carbon footprint = Higher eco-points

### Sustainability Score
```javascript
sustainabilityScore = Math.max(0, Math.min(100, 100 - (totalCarbon / 50) * 100))
```
- **Scale**: 0-100 points
- **Grading**: A+ (90+), A (80+), B (70+), C (60+), D (50+), F (<50)
